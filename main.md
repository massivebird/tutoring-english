# Miscellaneous

## Pronouncing years
   + Years of four numbers are often pronounced by separating the first two numbers from the last two
      + When the last two numbers are both zeroes (00), it is pronounced "hundred"
      + Examples:
         + 2000: "two thousand"
         + 1921: "nineteen twenty one"
         + 1600: "sixteen hundred"

### Pronouncing plural years
   + The "nineteen twenties" (1920s) is the decade ranging from 1920 to 1929.
   + The letter X is used to represent a number of unknown value
      + You'll see this in science fiction movies and books.
      + This allows writers to convey that the story just takes place "in the future" rather than in a specific year.
      + Examples:
         + 30XX: "thirty X X": could be any year from 3000 to 3099.
